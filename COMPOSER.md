# Composer Setup for Typeform Quizzes

This plugin supports both Composer autoloading and fallback autoloading for maximum compatibility.

## For Developers

If you have Composer installed locally:

```bash
composer install
```

This will generate the optimized autoloader in `vendor/autoload.php`.

## For Production WordPress Installs

The plugin automatically falls back to the custom autoloader (`src/autoload.php`) if Composer is not available, ensuring compatibility with all WordPress hosting environments.

## Benefits of Composer Autoloading

- **Performance**: Optimized autoloader with class mapping
- **PSR-4 Compliance**: Standard namespace-to-directory mapping
- **Development**: Better IDE support and debugging
- **Future-Proof**: Ready for additional Composer dependencies

## File Structure

```
typeform-quizzes/
├── composer.json          # Composer configuration
├── vendor/                # Generated by Composer (excluded from git)
├── src/                   # PSR-4 compliant source code
│   ├── autoload.php       # Fallback autoloader
│   └── ...
└── typeform-quizzes.php   # Main plugin file with autoload logic
```

## Autoload Logic

The plugin checks for autoloaders in this order:

1. `vendor/autoload.php` (Composer - preferred)
2. `src/autoload.php` (Fallback - always available)

This ensures the plugin works in all environments while providing optimal performance when Composer is available.
